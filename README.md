This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## What is this website for

This website is built as a songlist website so that you could search for your own favourite song based on song name or artist name. Songs are categorized by their respective genres.

### To-do List
  
  [ ] I could possibly add lyrics modal to each song cards on click.
  
  [ ] I could possibly add autocomplete to the search bar.

  [ ] I could possibly make the search bar global, instead of having a bunch of genre-specific search bar; The Search bar should always stick to the top for desktop users, while only show a search icon at the top right corner for mobile users.
